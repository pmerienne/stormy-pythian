==============

Stormy-Pythian goal is to make stream-mining easy.
It aims at providing a simple web interface allowing user to build real time predictive features at large scale.

Stormy-Pyhtian will help extracting value from data streams through different steps : 
* Get raw data (define/mix stream source)
* Analyze data (analytics, vizualization)
* Get good looking data (cleanup, featurization)
* Evaluate Algorithms (accuracy, latency, throughput)
* Deploy your data-flow

This project intend to be a solution for many applications : 
* User clustering
* Recommendation
* Ad placement
* Anomaly detection
